## How to use this?

You'll have to clone it locally. And with your terminal you go to the root folder and type:
```
npm run serve
```

this will boot a local test server. To add songs you will have to add them into the assets folder and change the data in the songs array in App.vue.

As an example I used three songs from [bensound](https://www.bensound.com/) Each song has a link to it in the comments.

it's not much, but I enjoyed learning to make this.
